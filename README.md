This project provides the client facing API for the PTero Workflow system.
This system is designed to be a highly scalable replacement of the [legacy
Workflow](https://github.com/genome/tgi-workflow) system from [The Genome
Institute](http://genome.wustl.edu/).

The API is currently described
[here](https://github.com/mark-burnett/ptero-apis/blob/master/workflow.md).
